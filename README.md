This project tries to develop a web-based system that facilitates final year projects
(FYP). The whole FYP is a year-long process involving groups of students and their
supervisors to accomplish a theme-based project.In order to
manage and reduce the work processes, FYP management system has to be developed to
fasten the work processes of the project. The main purpose is to reduce the time taken during
the processes and save cost by reducing the unnecessary paper works. Besides saving the
manpower in performing the processes, the steps in the workflow can be reduced as well.
Four type of users are involved in an FYP whole process naming FYP Committee, Project Supervisors, Panel Members, and the Project
Group Members (Students).Every user involved in the process has their own User Interface.

FYP Committee Interface
In FYPs the main role is of the FYP Committee. This view will be for the FYP
Committee so only those faculty members access it who are part of FYP Committee. FYP
Committee are users with authority to specify new users, specify users’ roles and grant general
privileges for users. They create users like students, faculty and from faculty the committee
make panels and choose supervisors. They should be allowed to see the students that are
registered in FYP I, their group members, supervisors, project details. The FYP Committee
also check the workload of the supervisors one supervisor can only supervised 6 FYPs, if any
supervisor is supervising more than 6 FYPs, then some groups of that supervisors are assigned
to supervisor with less workload to equal the load of all the supervisors. FYP committee can
send notification to the supervisors to notify and confirm with the supervisors with the
students that they are undertaking. For notifications you can make a table of notifications.
After the successful completion of the assignment of the 6 FYPs to the supervisors, then the
FYP Committee creates the Panels comprising of the Faculty Members. FYPs are assigned to
the panels which they will evaluate based on their work. The evaluation form is given below
the panel members fill this form and the marks given in the form are added and the grades are
generated based on these marks. The FYP Committee can easily identify from the evaluation
forms that which panel members evaluations are missing and as well as which FYPs are not
presented by students as their evaluation will also be missing. The FYP Committee also assign
deadlines of submissions or evaluations, and the other roles should view the deadlines. The
FYP Committee will has full access to search the missing evaluations and FYPs. There will a
be proper report generation process too. The FYP Committee will generate following reports:
 Missing Evaluation Report: This report contains all the missing evaluations like
missing assessment items of the students, missing student evaluation by any faculty
member.
 FYPs Supervised by Faculty Report: This report contains that which faculty
member is supervising which FYPs and workload count.
 Grades Report: This report contains grades statistics of students who get A’s grade,
and other grades also, statistics of faculty member who gave the most A’s grade.


Panel Members Interface
This view will be for the faculty members so only those faculty members access it who are part
of any panel. The panel members view the FYPs that are part of their panel like group members
of the FYP, description of the FYP etc. It is mandatory that every panel member that is present
in the project presentation fill the evaluation form. If they do not fill any form then the view
shows the missing evaluations, panel member should easily check that this evaluation form is
missing then the panel member can fill it. The panel member should only search the FYPs that
are part of his/her panel. It is important that one faculty member is in one panel. One faculty
member cannot part of two or more panels.


Project Supervisors Interface
This view is for the supervisors so only those faculty members access it who are supervising
FYPs in the current semester. The supervisors cannot supervise more than 6 FYPs. The
supervisors can see the FYPs that are active, it means that those FYPs which are supervising
currently and details of those FYPs like group information, in which panels the FYPs are
assigned, and grades of the FYPs at the end of evaluation. When the panel members are
evaluating the projects, if they want to add some reviews and suggestions to the supervisor
then they can, and the supervisor can view those comments. The supervisor can also view the
deadlines of the FYP related assessments. If the supervisor of the FYP does not give reviews
to the FYPs which he/she is supervising then this view should show the missing reviews so
that the supervisor gives reviews later.


Students Interface
This view is for the students who registered themselves in FYP I, so only those students access
it who are registered in FYP I in the current semester. The student can see his/her group
members (with whom student is working on FYP), project title/description (on which project
is working), supervisor (who is supervising their project). The students can see the panels to
which they are assigned that panel will evaluate their FYP. During the evaluation the panel
gives reviews or suggestions to the FYPs so the students can see the comments/ reviews given
to their FYP so they can improve their work, but you must make sure that the name of the
panel member who gives the reviews or suggestions should not be visible to the student. Make
sure that they only see the reviews or suggestions not the information of the panel member.
The deadlines of the presentations, submissions of the documents etc. will be visible to the
student to ease them to complete the assigned work on time. If the grades are finalized, then
the students can also see their grades of the FYPs in this view.
